**Reclaim lost SOL. Burn nothing.**

Moon Incinerator helps you clean up unused Solana accounts and processes to recover storage rent and SOL â€” without destroying your tokens or NFTs.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Identify reclaimable SOL from unused accounts  
- âœ… Safely close empty or inactive accounts  
- âœ… Reduce rent costs by minimizing unnecessary storage  
- âœ… 100% non-destructive (your NFTs and tokens are safe)  
- âœ… One-click Moonshot integration

## ðŸ”¥ Why "Incinerator"?

Because we **burn waste**, not assets. Moon Incinerator doesnâ€™t delete your valuables â€” it finds abandoned or bloated accounts sucking your SOL and shuts them down cleanly. Think of it like Marie Kondo for your wallet.

---

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. Connect your wallet via [Moonshot](https://moonshot.link)
2. Navigate to the **Cleanup** tab
3. Review reclaimable accounts and storage bloat
4. Click **Incinerate** to safely reclaim your SOL

## ðŸ§  Safety

- Does **not** touch NFTs, tokens, or active programs  
- Only targets system accounts eligible for safe closure  
- Transactions are signed and visible before execution
